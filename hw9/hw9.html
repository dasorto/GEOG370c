<h1>Homework 9: Choropleth of Honduras:
    This is a map that displays the percentage of homes with internet access in different municipalities in Honduras.
    An issue I ran into was how to allign the codes of the municipalities to make the join. I chose this map since I wanted to know if, 
    given the situation of the pandemic, there is a possibility for e-learning in some areas.
